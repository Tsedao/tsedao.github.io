Note: for some distribution, we need to calculate the distribution using indicator function based on its support.\nLocation and Scale Family  Let $f(x)$ be any pdf. Then the family of pdfs $f(x-\\mu)$, indexed by the parameter $\\mu$ is called the location family.  If Z has a pdf $f(z)$, then $X=Z+\\mu$ has density $f(x-\\mu)$   Let $f(x)$ be any pdf. Then the family of pdfs $\\frac{1}{\\sigma}f(\\frac{x}{\\sigma})$ is called the scale family with standard pdf $f(x)$ How to prove the above statement? Event equivalence!  ${X = x } \\Leftrightarrow {Z = \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}}$ $P(X=x)=P(Z=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma})$ $f_{X}(x)dx=f(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma})dz$    Data Reduction Why reduction? Summarize the information in a sample by determine a few key features of the sample values\nHow to do reduction? The method that do not discard important information about unknown parameter $\\theta$ and methods that successfully discard information that is irrelevant as far as gaining knowledge about $\\theta$ is concerned.\nSufficiency Definition: $P(X=x | T(X)=T(x))$ is independent of $\\theta$. The conditional distribution of a sample $X$ given the value $T(X)$ does not depend on $\\theta$.\nIt turns out that outside the exponential family distribution, it is rare to have a sufficient statistic of smaller dimension of the sample.\nHow to find sufficiency statistic?\n $\\frac{p(x|\\theta)}{q(T(x|\\theta)}$ independent of $\\theta$ Factorization theorem $f(x|\\theta)=h(x)g(T(x)|\\theta)$ Using exponential family $\\sum_{i}^{n}t(X_{i})$  $T'(x) = r(T(x))$, if $T'$ is sufficient, then $T$ is also sufficient. The converse of the statement is false.\nMinimal Sufficiency Statistic Why M.S.S? We have many sufficiency statistics and any one-to-one function of a sufficient statistic is a sufficient statistic.\nDefinition: A sufficient statistic T is called minimal sufficient statistic if, for any other sufficient statistic T', T is a function of T'.\nHow to find M.S.S?\n $\\frac{f(x|\\theta)}{f(y|\\theta)}$ is independent of $\\theta$ if and only if $T(x) = T(y)$  Ancillary Definition: A statistic S(X) whose distribution does not depend on the parameter $\\theta$ is called ancillary statistic. i.e. ($P(S(X)| \\theta)$ independent of $\\theta$ )\nCompleteness Definition: $E_{\\theta}(g(T)) = 0$ for all $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ implies $P_{\\theta}(g(T)=0)=1$ for $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ . Then $T(X)$ is called complete statistic\nInterpretation:\n No ancillary statistic can be constructed based on complete statistic. Unique unbiased estimator, i.e., $E(T(x)) =\\tau(\\theta)$  Disprove\n Construct ancillary statistic $g(T)=S(T)-E(S(T))$, $P(g(T)) \\ne 0$ Just cancel First moment  Prove\n Direct calculate $E(g(T))=0$, or take the derivative related to $\\theta$ Using Full exponential family i.e., d=k  Note:\n $T' = r(T)$, if T is complete, then T' is also complete. A complete statistic can be not sufficient.  Basu\u0026rsquo;s Theorem T(X) is complete and minimal sufficient statistic, then T(X) is independent of every ancillary statistic.\nBahadur\u0026rsquo;s Theorem C.S.S is in M.S.S.\nNote:\n If there exists a T(x) to be M.S.S., but not complete, then no sufficient statistic is complete. If there exists a T(x) such that T is C.S.S and M.S.S, then any M.S.S are also C.S.S.  Point Estimation Methods of Finding Point Estimators Method of Moment Drawback: sometimes the estimator will out of range\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation     Scalar Multidimension     Continuous Yes (Second order sufficient condition SOSC) Yes   Discrete Yes No (Discrete optimization)    Advantage: the range of MLE coincides the range of parameters.\nDrawback:\n  Difficult to find a global maximum\n  numerical sensitivity. That is how sensitive the estimator to the small change in the data.\n  Invariance property of MLE. i.e., MLE of $\\tau(\\theta)$ is $\\tau(\\hat{\\theta})$\nBayes Estimator Data: (x1,x2,\u0026hellip;xn) + Expert Knowledge $f(x|\\theta) \\text{ or } \\pi(x)$\nCons: controversial because it inherently embraces a subjective notion of probability. It has no guarantee of long time performance\nPosterior distribution: $\\pi(\\theta|x) = f(x|\\theta)\\pi(\\theta)/ m(x)$\nMethods of Evaluating Point Estimators Mean Square Error (MSE) MSE = $E_{\\theta}(W-\\theta)^{2}=Var_{\\theta}(W)+(Bias_{\\theta}(W))^{2}$\nMSE is not good for scale parameter (i.e. $\\sigma$ in normal distribution), since it MSE penalizes equally for overestimation and underestimation. And the scale case, 0 is a natural lower bound, so the estimation problem is not symmetric.\nBest Unbiased Estimator (Minimize variance and control bias) Motivation: many times we can a estimator that is uniformly better than the other estimator. (i.e., MSE($\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}$)\u0026lt;MSE($S^{2}$) for any $\\sigma^{2} \u0026gt; 0$). If we can find an unbiased estimator with uniformly smallest variance, a best unbiased estimator, then our task is done.\n  UMVUE (uniform minimum variance unbiased estimator)\n  Cramer-Rao Inequality Cramer-Rao Lower Bound valid or not?\nWe can specify a lower bound, say $B(\\theta)$, on the variance of any unbiased estimator of $\\tau(\\theta)$. If we can attain such lower bound, we can say we have found a best unbiased estimator.\n  Attainment\nThere is no guarantee that the bound is sharp.\n  Use of sufficiency and unbiasedness\nRao-Blackwell gives decrease property conditioned on sufficiency\nCondition a unbiased statistic based on a sufficient statistic $T$, i.e., $\\phi(T)=E(W|T)$， then $E_{\\theta}\\phi(T)=\\tau(\\theta)$ and $Var_{\\theta}(\\phi(T)) \\leq Var_{\\theta}(W)$ for all $\\theta$.\nUniqueness of best estimator\n DISPROVE BEST ESTIMATOR (IF IT IS NOT ATTAINED BY CRLB): If $E_{\\theta}W = \\tau(\\theta)$, W is the best unbiased estimator of $\\tau(\\theta)$ if and only if $W$ is uncorrelated with all unbiased estimators of 0.\n  If T is complete and sufficient statistic, then the unbiased estimator of $\\tau(\\theta)$, $\\phi(T)$ is uncorrelated with any unbiased estimator of 0. So that it gives the best estimator\n   Minimize Risk Function Hypothesis test Definition: A hypothesis is a a statement about a population parameter. A hypothesis test is a rule that specifies 1.
